# Build A Salary Prediction Web App With Streamlit

A Machine Learning web application was built from scratch in Python with Streamlit.

Real world data was used from Stack Overflow 2022 surveys to build a machine learning model.

Data was first analysed and cleaned in notebooks and a subsequent model was trained and tested.

Finally the web app was designed and served using streamlit.

Please run `streamlit run app.py` to view the completed app.
